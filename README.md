A Minecraft (1.21.1) datapack designed to work (unofficialy) with ProtoManly's Weather mod.

Any time an item is "crafted" (or smelted, apparently), it spawns a supercell.

Notes for future me:
+Maybe optimize by ticking in chunks rather than the whole list
+Consider adding pseudo-randomness (list and counter), to rarely spawn a tornado (offset from player)
